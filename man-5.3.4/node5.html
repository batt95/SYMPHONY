A Brief History
</H1>

<P>
Since the inception of optimization as a recognized field of study in
mathematics, researchers have been both intrigued and stymied by the
difficulty of solving many of the most interesting classes of discrete
optimization problems. Even combinatorial problems, though conceptually easy
to model as integer programs, have long remained challenging to solve in
practice. The last two decades have seen tremendous progress in our ability to
solve large-scale discrete optimization problems. These advances have
culminated in the approach that we now call <I>branch and cut</I>, a technique
(see [<A
 HREF="node282.html#Grotschel84cut">19</A>,<A
 HREF="node282.html#padb:branc">29</A>,<A
 HREF="node282.html#hoff:LP">20</A>]) which brings the computational
tools of branch and bound algorithms together with the theoretical tools of
polyhedral combinatorics. Indeed, in 1998, Applegate, Bixby, Chv&#225;tal, and
Cook used this technique to solve a <EM>Traveling Salesman Problem</EM> instance
with 13,509 cities, a full order of magnitude larger than what had been
possible just a decade earlier [<A
 HREF="node282.html#concorde">2</A>] and two orders of magnitude
larger than the largest problem that had been solved up until 1978. This feat
becomes even more impressive when one realizes that the number of variables in
the standard formulation for this problem is approximately the <EM>square</EM> of
the number of cities. Hence, we are talking about solving a problem with
roughly <EM>100 million variables</EM>.

<P>
There are several reasons for this impressive progress. Perhaps the most
important is the dramatic increase in available computing power over the last
decade, both in terms of processor speed and memory. This increase in the
power of hardware has subsequently facilitated the development of increasingly
sophisticated software for optimization, built on a wealth of theoretical
results. As software development has become a central theme of optimization
research efforts, many theoretical results have been ``re-discovered'' in
light of their new-found computational importance. Finally, the use of
parallel computing has allowed researchers to further leverage their gains.

<P>
Because of the rapidly increasing sophistication of computational techniques,
one of the main difficulties faced by researchers who wish to apply these
techniques is the level of effort required to develop an efficient
implementation. The inherent need for incorporating problem-dependent methods
(most notably for dynamic generation of variables and cutting planes) has
typically required the time-consuming development of custom implementations.
Around 1993, this led to the development by two independent research groups of
software libraries aimed at providing a generic framework that users could
easily customize for use in a particular problem setting. One of these groups,
headed by J&#252;nger and Thienel, eventually produced ABACUS (A Branch And CUt
System) [<A
 HREF="node282.html#abacus1">21</A>], while the other, headed by the authors, produced what
was then known as COMPSys (Combinatorial Optimization Multi-processing
System). After several revisions to enable more broad functionality, COMPSys
became SYMPHONY (Single- or Multi-Process Optimization over Networks). A
version of SYMPHONY written in C++, which we call COIN/BCP has also been
produced at IBM under the COIN-OR project [<A
 HREF="node282.html#coin-or">24</A>]. The COIN/BCP package
takes substantially the same approach and has the same functionality as
SYMPHONY, but has extended SYMPHONY's capabilities in some areas.

The C++ API
</H2>

<P>
The Open Solver Interface (OSI) is a C++ class that provides a standard API
for accessing a variety of solvers for mathematical programs. It is provided
as part of the COIN-OR repository [<A
 HREF="node282.html#coin-or">24</A>], along with a collection of
solver-specific derived classes that translate OSI call into calls to the
underlying libraries of the solvers. A code implemented using calls to the
methods in the OSI base class can easily be linked with any solver for which
there is an OSI interface. This allows development of solver-independent codes
and eliminates many portability issues. The current incarnation of OSI
supports only solvers for linear and mixed-integer linear programs, although a
new version supporting a wider variety of solvers is currently under
development.

<P>
We have implemented an OSI interface for SYMPHONY 5.3.4 that allows any solver
built with SYMPHONY to be accessed through the OSI, including customized
solvers and those configured to run on parallel architectures. To ease code
maintenance, for each method in the OSI base class, there is a corresponding
method in the callable library. The OSI methods are implemented simply as
wrapped calls to the SYMPHONY callable library. When an instance of the OSI
interface class is constructed, a call is made to
<TT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"> sym_open_environment()</FONT></TT> and a pointer to the environment is stored
in the class. Most subsequent calls within the class can then be made without
any arguments. When the OSI object is destroyed,
<TT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"> sym_close_environment</FONT></TT> is called and the environment is destroyed.

<P>
To fully support SYMPHONY's capabilities, we have extended the OSI interface to
include some methods not in the base class. For example, we added calls
equivalent to our <TT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"> sym_parse_command_line()</FONT></TT> and
<TT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"> sym_find_initial_bounds()</FONT></TT>. Figure <A HREF="#OSI_main">3.5</A> shows the
program of Figure <A HREF="node54.html#default_main">3.1</A> implemented using the OSI interface.

Note that the code would be exactly the same for accessing any customized
SYMPHONY solver, sequential or parallel.

<P>
Although we are using the OSI to access a MILP solver, the current version of
the OSI is geared primarily toward support of solvers for linear programming
(LP) problems. This is because LP solvers employing some version of the
simplex algorithm support much richer functionality and a wider range of
interface functions, due to their support of warm starting from previously
saved checkpoints. This functionality is difficult to provide for MILP
solvers.  In SYMPHONY 5.3.4, we have implemented for MILPs some of the same
functionality that has long been available for LP solvers. As such, our OSI
interface supports warm starting and sensitivity analysis. The implementations
of this functionality is straightforward at the moment, but will be improved
in future versions.

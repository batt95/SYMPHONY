<P>
One of the most important considerations in designing a branch and cut
implementation is what data structures to use for storing and
accessing cuts, variables, and search tree nodes. As with many
decisions, there are two opposing goals to keep in mind--efficiency
and memory conservation. Memory is an important issue not only because
the search tree can get very large, but also because communications
bandwidth is limited. We need to store the tree in as compact a form
as possible and yet be able to access the data efficiently. Accessing
the data involves building the data structures required by
the LP solver to process the node.
<P>
SYMPHONY's data structures are designed specifically to deal
efficiently with large numbers of cuts and variables. Cuts and
variables are treated symmetrically whenever possible. For instance,
candidates for strong branching can be either cuts, variables, or
both--the implementation is exactly the same. Similarly, both cuts
and variables can be generated dynamically as the algorithm proceeds.
However, there are also some differences in how cuts and variables
are stored and accessed, as discussed below.

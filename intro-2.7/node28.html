<P>
SYMPHONY is designed to be fault tolerant. This is a requirement for
solving large problems on networks whose processors may fail
unpredictably. The tree manager tracks the status of all processes and
can restart them as necessary. Since the state of the entire tree is
known at all times, the most that will be lost if an LP process or cut
generator process is killed is the work that had been completed on that
particular search node. To protect against the tree manager itself or
a cut pool being killed, full logging capabilities have been
implemented. If desired, the tree manager can write out the entire
state of the tree to disk periodically, allowing a warm restart if a
fault occurs. Similarly, the cut pool process can be warm-started from
a log file. This not only allows for fault tolerance but also
for full reconfiguration of the algorithm in the middle of solving
a long-running problem. Such reconfiguration could consist of
anything from adding more processors to moving the entire solution
process to another network.

To track problem variables, each must be assigned a unique <EM>user
index</EM> by which the user can always identify the variable. For
instance, if the variables correspond to the edges of a graph, as in
the Traveling Salesman Problem, then the index can simply be derived
from a lexicographic ordering of these edges. This indexing requirement
means that the user must have a priori knowledge of all problem
variables. For most combinatorial models, this does not present a
problem. However, for some set partitioning models, for instance, the
number of columns may not be known in advance. This
restriction will be eliminated in a future release of SYMPHONY.
<P>
The problem variables are divided into two sets, the <EM>base
variables</EM> and the <EM>extra variables</EM>. The base variables remain in
the problem at all times, whereas the extra variables can be removed
by reduced cost or logical fixing, as well as generated by column
generation (see Section <A HREF="node23.html#lprelaxation">5.2.2</A> for details). There is no
theoretical difference between base variables and extra variables;
however, designating a base set of variables can increase efficiency
since they only need to be sent out to each process once at the
beginning of the computation. Also, because they can move in and out of the
problem, maintaining extra variables requires additional bookkeeping
and computation. If the user has reason to believe a priori that a
variable is ``good'' or has a high probability of being involved in an
optimal solution to the problem, then that variable should be
designated as a base variable. For instance, in graph-based
minimization problems, such as the TSP, the cheapest <I>k</I> edges
adjacent to each node could be designated as the base set.
<P>
SYMPHONY supports variable fixing by reduced cost, as well as dynamic
column generation. The variables included in the current LP relaxation
are called the <EM>active variables</EM>. It is up to the user to
designate which variables will be active in the root node. Typically,
only base variables are active, but the user may want to include some
extra variables as well. The details of variable fixing and dynamic
column generation are given in Section <A HREF="node23.html#lprelaxation">5.2.2</A>.

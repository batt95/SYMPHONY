Because of the clear partitioning of work that occurs when the
branching operation generates new subproblems, branch and bound
algorithms lend themselves particularly well to parallelization. As a
result, there is already a significant body of research on performing
branch and bound in parallel environments. For a survey of parallel
branch and bound algorithms, see the article by Gendron and Crainic
[<A HREF="node34.html#GSPMampC">10</A>].
<P>
We first define some terms. A <EM>processor</EM>, or <EM>serial
processor</EM>, refers to a single serial computing device. A <EM>
parallel processor</EM> or <EM>parallel machine</EM> consists of multiple
serial processors which are connected by efficient communication
pathways. There are two types of parallel processors, <EM>
synchronous</EM> and <EM>asynchronous</EM>. In a synchronous model of
computation, the individual processors use a common central clock and
hence can synchronize easily. We consider an asynchronous model, in
which the individual processors run independently and can only
synchronize with each other through explicit communication. The memory
of the parallel machine can be either <EM>shared</EM> or <EM>
distributed</EM>. In shared memory, all processors read from and write to
a common memory space. We will use a distributed memory model in which
each processor only has access to its own memory space. A <EM>
process</EM> will refer to a single computer program executing commands
serially on a single processor. A process can be started directly by
the user or by another process. In the second case, we say the first
process <EM>spawns</EM> the second process. The method by which processes
communicate with each other is called the <EM>communication
protocol</EM>. We use a <EM>message passing</EM> protocol in which the
processes communicate by explicitly sending messages to each other. A
message has a <EM>data array</EM>, a <EM>message tag</EM>, a <EM>sender</EM>,
and one or more <EM>receivers</EM> associated with it. When one process
sends a message to another, the second process must explicitly receive
that message and know the structure of the message by looking at the
message tag.
<P>
In parallel branch and cut, there are two major sources of
parallelism. First, it is clear that any number of subproblems on the
current candidate list can be processed simultaneously. Once a subproblem
has been added to the list, it can be properly processed before,
during, or after the processing of any other subproblem. This is not
to say that processing a particular node at a different point in the
algorithm won't produce different results--it most certainly
will--but the algorithm will terminate correctly in any case.
<P>
The second major source of parallelism is to parallelize the
processing of individual subproblems. By allowing separation to be
performed in parallel with the solution of the linear programs, we can
theoretically process a node in little more than the amount of time it
takes to solve the sequence of LP relaxations. Most parallel
implementations (including ours) employ a master-slave model, in which
there is a central manager responsible for partitioning the work and
parceling it out to the various slave processes, which perform the
actual computation. The computation divides naturally into five
different process types, which interact with each other through
message-passing. In the next few sections, we introduce each of these
five classes of processes and summarize their basic functions. In
Sections <A HREF="node12.html#design">4</A> and <A HREF="node19.html#modules">5</A>, we will discuss the
implementation of each process in more detail.

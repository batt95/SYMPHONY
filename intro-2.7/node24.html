Branching takes place whenever either (1) both cut generation and
column generation (if it is performed) have failed, (2) ``tailing
off'' in the objective function value has been detected (if this
option is selected), or (3) the user chooses to force
branching. Branching can take place on cuts or variables and can be
fully automated or fully controlled the user, as desired. Branching
can result in as many children as the user desires, though two is
typical. Once it is decided that branching will occur, the user must
either select the list of candidates for <EM>strong branching</EM> (see
below for the procedure) or allow the framework to do so automatically
by using one of several built-in strategies, such as branching on the
variable whose value is farthest from integrality.
<P>
After the list of candidates is selected, each candidate is <EM>
pre-solved</EM>, by performing a specified number of iterations of the
dual simplex algorithm in each child that would result from branching
on the candidate object. Based on the objective function values
obtained in each of the potential children, the final branching object
is selected, again either by the user or by built-in rule. When the
branching object has been selected, the LP process sends a description
of it to the tree manager, which creates the
children and adds them to the list of candidate nodes. It is then up
to the tree manager to specify which node the now-idle LP process
should process next. That issue will be addressed in Section

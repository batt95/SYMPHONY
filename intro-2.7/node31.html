The cut pool's primary job is to receive a fractional solution from an
LP process and return cuts from the pool that are violated by it. The
cuts are stored along with two pieces of information--the level of
the tree on which the cut was generated, known simply as the <EM>
level</EM> of the cut, and the number of times it has been checked for
violation since the last time it was actually found to be violated,
known as the number of <EM>touches</EM>. The number of touches a cut has
is used as a simplistic measure of its effectiveness. Since the pool
can get quite large, the user can choose to scan only cuts whose
number of touches is below a specified threshold and/or cuts that were
generated on a level at or above the current one in the tree. The idea
behind this second criteria is to try to avoid checking cuts that were
not generated ``nearby'' in the tree, as they are less likely to be
effective. Any cut that was generated at a level in the tree that is
below the level of the current node must have been generated in a
different part of the tree. This is admittedly a naive method. All
duplicate cuts, as well as all cuts whose number of touches has
exceeded a pre-specified threshold are periodically purged from the
pool to keep it as small as possible.

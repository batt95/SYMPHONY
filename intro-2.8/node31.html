<P>
The cut pool's primary job is to receive a fractional solution from an
LP process and return cuts from the pool that are violated by it. The
cuts are stored along with two pieces of information--the level of
the tree on which the cut was generated, known simply as the <EM>level</EM> of the cut, and the number of times it has been checked for
violation since the last time it was actually found to be violated,
known as the number of <EM>touches</EM>. The number of touches a cut has
can be used as a simplistic measure of its effectiveness. Since the pool
can get quite large, the user can choose to scan only cuts whose
number of touches is below a specified threshold and/or cuts that were
generated on a level at or above the current one in the tree. The idea
behind this second criteria is to try to avoid checking cuts that were
not generated ``nearby'' in the tree, as they are less likely to be
effective. Any cut that was generated at a level in the tree that is
below the level of the current node must have been generated in a
different part of the tree. This is admittedly a naive method. 

<P>
On the other hand, the user may define her own measure of quality for
each cut and that will be used instead. For example, the degree of
violation is a simple example. This measure of quality must be
computed by the user since the cut pool does not know anything about
the packed cuts. The quality is recomputed every time the user checks
the cut for violation and a running average is used as the final
quality measure. The cuts in the pool are periodically sorted by this
measure of quality and only the highest quality cuts are checked each
time. All duplicate cuts, as well as all cuts whose number of touches
has exceeded or quality is below a specified threshold are
periodically purged from the pool to keep it as small as possible.

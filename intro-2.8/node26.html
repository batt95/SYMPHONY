Managing the Search Tree
</H3>

<P>
The tree manager's primary job is to control the execution of the
algorithm by deciding which candidate node should be chosen as the
next to be processed. This is done using one of the several built-in
rules such as selecting the node with the lowest lower bound. Because
it is expensive to construct a search node from scratch, the tree
manager will often allow an LP process to retain one of the children
resulting from branching in order to avoid the set-up costs associated
with redistributing that node at a later time. This is called <EM>diving</EM> and the resulting chain of nodes is called a <EM>search
chain</EM>. There are various rules available for deciding when an LP
process should be allowed to dive. One such rule is to look at the
number of variables in the current LP solution that are fractional.
When this number is low, there is a good chance of finding a feasible
solution quickly by diving. We also dive if one of the children is
``close'' to being the best node, where ``close'' is defined by a
chosen parameter. In addition to the time saved by avoiding
reconstruction of the LP in the child, diving has the apparent
advantage of leading to the discovery of feasible solutions quickly.
Since every feasible solution lies at the end of a search chain, it
seems reasonable to dive periodically. Therefore, random diving takes
place according to a specified parameter.

Managing the LP Relaxation
</H3>

<P>
The majority of the computational effort of branch and cut is spent
solving LPs and hence a major emphasis in the development was to make
this process as efficient as possible. Besides using a good LP engine,
the primary way in which this is done is by controlling the size of
each relaxation, both in terms of number of active variables and
number of active constraints. The standard column-ordered format is
used for storage of the matrix since this is the format used by most
LP engines. With sparse matrices, this format provides the most
efficient storage of the matrix.

<P>
The number of constraints is controlled through use of a local cut
pool and through purging of ineffective constraints. When a cut is
generated by the cut generator, it is first sent to the local cut
pool. In each iteration, up to a specified number of the strongest
cuts (measured by degree of violation) from the local pool are added
to the problem. Cuts that are not strong enough to be added to the
relaxation are eventually purged from the list.  In addition, cuts are
purged from the LP itself when they have been deemed ineffective for
more than a specified number of iterations, where ineffective is
defined as either (1) the corresponding slack variable is positive,
(2) the corresponding slack variable is basic, or (3) the dual value
corresponding to the row is zero. Cuts that have remained effective in
the LP for a specified number of iterations are sent to the global
pool where they can be used in later search nodes. Cuts that have been
purged from the LP can be made made active again if they later become
violated.

<P>
The number of variables (columns) in the relaxation is controlled
through <EM>reduced cost fixing</EM> and <EM>dynamic column generation</EM>.
Periodically, each active variable is <EM>priced</EM> to see if it can be
fixed by reduced cost. If the matrix is <EM>full</EM> at the time of
the fixing, meaning that all unfixed variables are active, then
the fixing is permanent for that subtree. Otherwise, it is temporary
and only remains in force until the next time that columns are
dynamically generated.

<P>
Dynamic column generation is costly and hence takes place only either
(1) before branching (optional), or (2) when a node is about to be
pruned (depending on the phase--see the description of the two-phase
algorithm in Section <A HREF="node27.html#two-phase">5.3.2</A>). To use dynamic column
generation, the user must supply a subroutine which generates the
column corresponding to a particular user index, given the list of
active constraints in the current relaxation. When column generation
occurs, each column not currently active that has not been previously
priced out is either priced out immediately, or becomes active in the
current relaxation. Only <IMG

columns may enter the problem at a
time, so when that limit is reached, column generation ceases. Further
discussion of column generation will take place in Section <A HREF="node27.html#two-phase">5.3.2</A>,
where the two-phase algorithm is described.

<P>
Since the matrix is stored in compressed form, it can be expensive to
add and remove rows and columns. Hence, rows and columns are only
physically removed from the problem when there are enough of them to
make it ``worthwhile.'' Otherwise, deleted rows and columns remain in
the matrix but are simply ignored by the computation. This is
a convenient way to handle row deletion since rows
are expensive to delete from a column-ordered matrix and they tend to
move in and out more frequently.

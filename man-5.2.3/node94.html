Parallel Configurations</A>
</H2>

<P>
SYMPHONY supports numerous configurations, ranging from completely
sequential to fully parallel, allowing efficient execution in many
different computational settings. As described in the previous
section, there are five modules in the standard distributed
configuration. Various subsets of these modules can be
combined to form separate executables capable of communicating
with each other across a network. When two or more modules are combined,
they simply communicate through shared-memory instead of through
message-passing. However, they are also forced to run in sequential
fashion in this case, unless the user chooses to enable threading
using an OpenMP compliant compiler (see next section). 

<P>
As an example, the default distributed configuration includes a
separate executable for each module type, allowing full parallelism.
However, if cut generation is fast and not memory-intensive,
it may not be worthwhile to have the NP module and its associated cut
generator work independently, as this increases communication
overhead without much potential benefit. In this case, the cut
generator functions can be called directly from the NP module,
creating a single, more efficient executable.

The First Rule</A>
</H3>

<P>
SYMPHONY has many built-in options to make debugging easier. The most
important one, however, is the following rule. <B>It is easier to
debug the fully sequential version than the fully distributed
version</B>. Debugging parallel code is not terrible, but it is more
difficult to understand what is going on when you have to look at the
interaction of several different modules running as separate
processes. This means multiple debugging windows which have to be
closed and restarted each time the application is re-run. For this
reason, it is highly recommended to develop code that can be compiled
serially even if you eventually intend to run in a fully distributed
environment. This does make the coding marginally more complex, but
believe me, it's worth the effort. The vast majority of your code will
be the same for either case. Make sure to set the compile flag to
``<TT>-g</TT>'' in the make file.

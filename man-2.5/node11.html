<P>
Once the user functions are filled in and PVM is installed, all that
remains is to compile the application. The distribution comes with two
<TT>make</TT> files that facilitate this process. The primary <TT>make</TT>
file resides in the root directory. The user <TT>make</TT> file resides
in the user's subdirectory, initally called <TT>User/</TT>. There are a
number of variables that must be set in the primary <TT>make</TT> file.
Read the comments in the file <TT>Makefile</TT> to ensure that everything
is set properly. The user <TT>make</TT> file shouldn't require much
modification unless you add source files other than the ones included
in the distribution or change their names.
<P>
When you are ready, type ``<TT>make all</TT>'' to make the executables.
SYMPHONY will create three subdirectories--<TT>User/obj.*</TT> and <TT>
User/bin.*</TT>, where * is a number corresponding the current
architecture (determined by the <TT>PVM_ARCH</TT> environment variable)
containing the object and binary files, and a directory called <TT>
dependencies</TT>. If this operation is not successful, your architecture
may not be listed in the <TT>make</TT> file. Edit it by following the
example set by the architectures already included. Make sure to set
the corresponding path variables properly. Be sure to set the proper
links from the <TT>$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH</TT> as explained in the
previous section after compiling.

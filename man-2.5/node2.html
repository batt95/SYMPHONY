Here is a sketch outline of how to get started with SYMPHONY. 
<UL><LI> First, if you haven't already done so, unpack the
	distribution using the <TT>tar</TT> command.<LI> You must
	obtain and install the <EM><A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/">Parallel
	Virtual Machine</A></EM> (PVM)
	software, available for free from Oak Ridge National
	Laboratories. See
	Section <A HREF="node9.html#PVM">1.6</A> for more notes on using PVM.<LI> Edit the
	various path variables in the <TT>Makefile</TT> to match where
	you installed the distribution and where the PVM and LP
	libraries and header files reside for each architecture on
	your network. Other architecture-dependent variables should
	also be set as required.<LI> Type ``<TT>make all</TT>'' in the
	SYMPHONY root directory. This should make all of the
	executables for the sample application, a vehicle routing
	problem solver.<LI> Make sure there are links from your
	$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH/ directory to each of the
	executables in the User/bin.$REV directory. This is
	required by PVM.<LI> Start the PVM daemon by typing &quot;pvm&quot; on
	the command line.<LI> Run the sample application by typing
	``<TT>master User/par/sample.par</TT>''.
</UL>
This should result in the solution of a small vehicle routing problem.
Check out <TT><A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="http://branchandcut.org/VRP/">http://branchandcut.org/VRP/</A></TT> if you want to solve more vehicle
routing problems. Once you have accomplished this much, you are well
on your way to having an application of your own. Don't be daunted by
the seemingly endless list of user function that you are about to
encounter. Most of them are optional or have default options. If you
get lost, consult the source code for the sample application to see
how it's done.

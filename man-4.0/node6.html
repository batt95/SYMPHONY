A Brief History
</H1>

<P>
Since the inception of optimization as a recognized field of study in
mathematics, researchers have been both intrigued and stymied by the
difficulty of solving many of the most interesting classes of discrete
optimization problems. Even combinatorial problems, though
conceptually easy to model as integer programs, have long remained
challenging to solve in practice. The last two decades have seen
tremendous progress in our ability to solve large-scale discrete
optimization problems. These advances have culminated in the approach
that we now call <I>branch and cut</I>, a technique (see [<A
 HREF="node157.html#GJ_SPMamp_R">15</A>,<A
 HREF="node157.html#P_SPMamp_R">27</A>,<A
 HREF="node157.html#H_SPMamp_P">17</A>]) which brings the computational tools of branch and bound
algorithms together with the theoretical tools of polyhedral
combinatorics. Indeed, in 1998, Applegate, Bixby, Chv&#225;tal, and Cook
used this technique to solve a <EM>Traveling Salesman Problem</EM>
instance with 13,509 cities, a full order of magnitude larger than
what had been possible just a decade earlier [<A
 HREF="node157.html#concorde">1</A>] and two
orders of magnitude larger than the largest problem that had been
solved up until 1978. This feat becomes even more impressive when one
realizes that the number of variables in the standard formulation for
this problem is approximately the <EM>square</EM> of the number of
cities. Hence, we are talking about solving a problem with roughly
<EM>100 million variables</EM>.

<P>
There are several reasons for this impressive progress. Perhaps the
most important is the dramatic increase in available computing power
over the last decade, both in terms of processor speed and memory.
This increase in the power of hardware has subsequently facilitated
the development of increasingly sophisticated software for
optimization, built on a wealth of theoretical results. As software
development has become a central theme of optimization research
efforts, many theoretical results have been ``re-discovered'' in light
of their new-found computational importance. Finally, the use of
parallel computing has allowed researchers to further leverage their
gains.

<P>
Because of the rapidly increasing sophistication of computational
techniques, one of the main difficulties faced by researchers who wish
to apply these techniques is the level of effort required to develop
an efficient implementation. The inherent need for incorporating
problem-dependent methods (most notably for dynamic generation of
variables and cutting planes) has typically required the
time-consuming development of custom implementations. Around 1993,
this led to the development by two independent research groups of
software libraries aimed at providing a generic framework that users
could easily customize for use in a particular problem setting. One of
these groups, headed by J&#252;nger and Thienel, eventually produced
ABACUS (A Branch And CUt System) [<A
 HREF="node157.html#abacus1">18</A>], while the other,
headed by the authors, produced what was then known as COMPSys
(Combinatorial Optimization Multi-processing System). After several
revisions to enable more broad functionality, COMPSys became SYMPHONY
(Single- or Multi-Process Optimization over Networks). 
A version of SYMPHONY written in C++, which we call
COIN/BCP has also been produced at IBM under the COIN-OR project
[<A
 HREF="node157.html#coin-or">8</A>]. The COIN/BCP package takes substantially the same
approach and has the same functionality as SYMPHONY, but has extended
SYMPHONY's capabilities in some areas.

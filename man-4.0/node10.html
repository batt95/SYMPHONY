In many applications, the bounding operation is accomplished using the
tools of linear programming (LP), a technique first described in full
generality by Hoffman and Padberg [<A
 HREF="node157.html#H_SPMamp_P">17</A>]. This general class of
algorithms is known as <EM>LP-based branch and bound</EM>. Typically, the
integrality constraints of an integer programming formulation of the
problem are relaxed to obtain a <EM>LP relaxation</EM>, which is then
solved to obtain a lower bound for the problem. In [<A
 HREF="node157.html#P_SPMamp_R">27</A>],
Padberg and Rinaldi improved on this basic idea by describing a method
of using globally valid inequalities (i.e., inequalities valid for the
convex hull of integer solutions) to strengthen the LP relaxation.
They called this technique <EM>branch and cut</EM>. Since then, many
implementations (including ours) have been fashioned around the
framework they described for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.

separation algorithms and heuristics to $\hat{x}$\  to get a set of

$c\hat{x}$\  is a lower bound on the value of an optimal element of
${\cal S}$.  STOP and return $\hat{x}$\  and the lower bound
$c\hat{x}$. Otherwise, set ${\cal C} \leftarrow {\cal C} \cup {\cal

Once we have failed to either prune the current subproblem or separate
the current fractional solution from <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="${\cal
P}$">, we are forced to
branch. The branching operation is accomplished by specifying a set of
hyperplanes which divide the current subproblem in such a way that the
current solution is not feasible for the LP relaxation of any of the
new subproblems. For example, in a combinatorial optimization problem,
branching could be accomplished simply by fixing a variable whose
current value is fractional to 0 in one branch and 1
in the other. The procedure is described more formally in Figure
<A HREF="node10.html#branching-fig">2.2</A>. Figure <A HREF="node10.html#gb_SPMamp_c">2.3</A> gives a high level description
of the generic branch and cut algorithm.

As with cutting planes, the columns of <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$A$"> can also be defined
implicitly if <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

current matrix, then variable <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="$x_i$"> is implicitly taken to have value
zero. The process of dynamically generating variables is called <EM>pricing</EM> in the jargon of linear programming, but can also be viewed
as that of generating cutting planes for the dual of the current
LP relaxation. Hence, LP-based branch and bound algorithms in which
the variables are generated dynamically when needed are known as <EM>branch and price</EM> algorithms. In [<A
 HREF="node157.html#B_SPMamp_PII">5</A>], Barnhart,
et al. provide a thorough review of these methods. 

<P>
When both variables and cutting planes are generated dynamically
during LP-based branch and bound, the technique becomes known as <EM>branch, cut, and price</EM> (BCP). In such a scheme, there is a pleasing
symmetry between the treatment of cuts and that of variables. We
further examine this symmetry later in the manual. For
now, however, it is important to note that while branch, cut, and
price does combine ideas from both branch and cut and branch and price
(which are very similar to each other anyway), combining the two
techniques requires much more sophisticated methods than either one
requires on its own. This is an important idea that is at the core of
our design.

<P>
In the remainder of the manual, we often use the term <EM>search
tree</EM>. This term derives from the common representation of the list of
subproblems as the nodes of a graph in which each subproblem is
connected only to its parent and its children. Storing the subproblems
in such a form is an important aspect of our global data structures.
Since the subproblems correspond to the nodes of this graph, they are
sometimes be referred to as <EM>nodes in the search tree</EM> or simply
as <EM>nodes</EM>. The <EM>root node</EM> or <EM>root</EM> of the tree is the
node representing the initial subproblem.

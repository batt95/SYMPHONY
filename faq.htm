<a NAME="2">What is branch, cut, and price?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Please see the branch, cut, and price <a
href="branchandcut/faq.htm">FAQ</a>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="1">What is SYMPHONY?</a> <br> <blockquote> SYMPHONY is a callable
library for solving mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) that can be
customized through a wide variety of user callback functions and control
parameters. It runs in both sequential and parallel environments (distributed-
or shared-memory). SYMPHONY's core solution methodology is a branch and cut
algorithm that incorporates most of the advanced solution management features
available in other codes. Branch and cut is a technique for solving
large-scale discrete optimization problems (see question <a
href="#2">below</a>). For a more complete description of SYMPHONY, click <a
href="description.htm">here</a> or see the on-line SYMPHONY <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/SYMPHONY/man-5.2/">manual</a>. </blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="15">What is open source software?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Open-source software is software that is distributed under an open-source
license. Open source license allow the user of the software certain rights,
such as access to the source code and the ability to redistribute the software
under certain conditions. The big advantage of open-source software is that
the user has access to the inner workings and can participate directly in
development efforts. This also allows development of highly specialized
versions of the original code. All of the software available on this site is
distributed under the <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-cplfaq.html">Common Public License</a>, an open
source license used by the <a href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>
project. For more information on open-source development, visit the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="16">What is COIN-OR?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
<a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> is the Computational Infrastructure
for Operations Research project and is a consortium of researchers and
practitioners from both academia and industry who support the development og
open-source software tools for operations research. The project is run by the
non-profit <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/foundation.html">COIN-OR
Foundation</a>. The software available on this site is part of the <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> software repository. All software
available at this site uses <a href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s
open-source <a href="SYMPHONY/license.htm">license</a>, called the <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-cplfaq.html"> Common
Public License</a>. </blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="3">Is SYMPHONY documented?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
There is an extensive <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/SYMPHONY/man-5.2/">user's
manual</a> available both on-line and in <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/doc/SYMPHONY-5.2-Manual.pdf">PDF</a>.
The manual is included with the standard distribution. There is also a simple
walkthrough <a
href="docs/SYMPHONY-Walkthrough.pdf">guide</a> to
developing an application with SYMPHONY.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="4">What platforms will SYMPHONY run on?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
SYMPHONY has been used on most common Unix platforms. It has tested under the
following operating systems
<ul>
<li>Linux
<li>SunOS/Solaris
<li>AIX
<li>IRIX
<li>OSF
<li>Microsoft Windows (serial mode only)
</ul>
It should be easy to port to others as well. 
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="5">What language is SYMPHONY written in?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
SYMPHONY is implemented in C, although it calls on some third-party codes
written in C++ and will compile using a C++ compiler. SYMPHONY also has a C++
interface derived from the <a href="www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> Open Solver 
Interface.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="6">How do I develop an application using SYMPHONY?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Starting with the SYMPHONY generic MILP solver, you customize the algorithm by
providing problem-specific subroutines, such as functions for performing cut
generation or branching, that inherently depend on problem structure. This is
described in more detail in the <a href="#3"> documentation</a>. There is also
a quick start guide in the README file included with the distribution and in
the <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/SYMPHONY/man-5.2/">user's manual</a>.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="13">Are there samples available to help in development?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
There are a number of <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/applications.htm">applications</a> available for
<a href="license.htm">download</a> that illustrate SYMPHONY development. There
is also a generic template code that can be used as a starting point for
customization.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="14">What modeling languages and file formats does SYMPHONY work with?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
SYMPHONY will read AMPL/GMPL files using GLPKs parser, or MPS file using <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s parser. It can also use <a
href="http://www.mat.ua.pt/thh/flopc/">FlopC++</a> as a modeling interface.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="7">Do I need additional software to use SYMPHONY?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
SYMPHONY requires the use of a third-party LP solver. The LP solver links with
the framework through a defined interface. Through <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s Open Solver Interface, it is now
possible to use most commonly available LP solvers, including a few
open-source alternatives. There are also native interfaces to CPLEX and OSL
that are slightly more efficient. SYMPHONY also relies on other third-party
software for some functionality. For instance, SYMPHONY can use <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s Cut Generator Library for
generating generic cutting planes, <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s MPS file parser for reading MPS
files and GLPKs parser for reading in AMPL files. It can also use <a
href="http://www.mat.ua.pt/thh/flopc/">FlopC++</a> as a modeling interface.
Most of the software needed is now included in the SYMPHONY distribution.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="8">What do I need to run SYMPHONY in parallel?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
To run SYMPHONY in a distributed memory environment requires the use
of a third-party communications protocol supporting basic
message-passing functions. Currently, there is an interface to
<a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/">Parallel Virtual Machine</a>,
an open source message-passing library available for free download
from Oak Ridge National Labs.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="9">How do I get SYMPHONY?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
FOr information on getting the latest SYMPHONY packaged release, go <a
href="index.htm">here</a>. 
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="11">What is the relationship of SYMPHONY and COIN/BCP?</a> <br>
<blockquote> COIN/BCP is a C++ framework based roughly on an ancestor of
SYMPHONY, so they take substantially the same approach and have similar
functionality. COIN/BCP was developed at IBM and is also part of the <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> software repository. Currently,
SYMPHONY is easier to use "out of the box" and is a better choice for
beginners. However, the most recent versions can only be used for implementing
pure branch and cut (without column generation). COIN/BCP is much better than
SYMPHONY in some areas, however, such as support for column generation.
COIN/BCP is missing some features that SYMPHONY has, such as an implementation
of global cut pools. SYMPHONY and COIN/BCP may be combined into a
third-generation framework currently under development. </blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="17">Should I just use a generic MILP solver?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Although many excellent generic MILP solvers employing a version of the branch
and cut algorithm are now available, most are not as flexible as framework
like SYMPHONY, which is designed to allow the user to insert specialized
methods that take advantage of problem structure. It is not possible to solve
many of the toughest discrete optimization problems without problem-specific
modifications to the generic algorithm. In recent versions of commercial MILP
solvers such as CPLEX, it has become possible to add problem-specific cuts and
customize certain features, but frameworks such as <a
href="SYMPHONY/">SYMPHONY</a> are more flexible and support a much wider range
of options. If you do not need to develop a custom code, then you are
probably better off with a commercial MILP solver. Of course, having access to
the full source code is also a big advantage of SYMPHONY and other
open-source alternatives.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="12">Is there a SYMPHONY users' mailing list?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Yes. To subscribe to the SYMPHONY user's list serve, click
<a href="http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo/coin-symphony">here</a>.

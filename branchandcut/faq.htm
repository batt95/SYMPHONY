<a NAME="2">What is branch, cut, and price?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Branch, cut, and price (BCP) is an LP-based branch and bound technique
for solving mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). In BCP, both cuts
and variables are generated dynamically throughout the search tree,
allowing the solution of large-scale instances.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="1">What software is available for branch, cut, and price?</a>
<br>
<blockquote> <p>Because branch, cut, and price depends inherently on
problem-specific techniques, many implementations are customized for a
particular problem setting. Numerous such specialized codes have been 
developed, for instance <a
href="http://http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/">CONCORDE</a>, a TSP solver.</p>

<p>Frameworks, on the other hand, implement just the generic parts of the
algorithm, leaving hooks for the user to insert customized
application-specific methods where needed. This allows quick development of
customized code without wasted effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/">SYMPHONY</a> is a framework for implementing branch and
cut algorithms in both sequential and parallel environments (distributed- or
shared-memory). There are also a numbner of other branch, cut, and price (BCP)
frameworks available. For a short list of other BCP software, click <a
href="software.htm">here</a></p> </blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="3">What does a branch, cut, and price framework do?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>A BCP framework implements just the generic parts of the BCP algorithm,
leaving hooks for the user to insert customized application-specific methods
where desired. This allows quick development of customized code without
wasted effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="4">What makes branch, cut, and price different from
branch and bound?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Branch, cut, and price is an implementation of branch and bound in which
linear programming is used to derive valid bounds during construction
of the search tree. Problem-specific cutting planes are used to
strengthen the linear programming relaxations used for bounding. This
makes it a much more powerful method than branch and bound alone. 
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="5">Should I just use a generic MILP solver?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Although many excellent generic MILP solvers employing a version of the branch
and cut algorithm are now available, most are not as flexible as framework
like SYMPHONY, which is designed to allow the user to insert specialized
methods that take advantage of problem structure. It is not possible to solve
many of the toughest discrete optimization problems without problem-specific
modifications to the generic algorithm. In recent versions of commercial MILP
solvers such as CPLEX, it has become possible to add problem-specific cuts and
customize certain features, but frameworks such as <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY/">SYMPHONY</a> are more flexible and support a much wider range
of options. If you do not need to develop a custom code, then you are
probably better off with a commercial MILP solver. Of course, having access to
the full source code is also a big advantage of SYMPHONY and other
open-source alternatives.

<a NAME="8">What is SYMPHONY?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="9">What applications are available?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Please click <a href="applications.htm">here</a> to see a list of branch, cut, and price applications built with SYMPHONY.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<a NAME="6">What is open source software?</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
Open-source software is software that is distributed under an open-source
license. Open source license allow the user of the software certain rights,
such as access to the source code and the ability to redistribute the software
under certain conditions. The big advantage of open-source software is that
the user has access to the inner workings and can participate directly in
development efforts. This also allows development of highly specialized
versions of the original code. For more information, visit the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>.

<hr>

<a NAME="7">What is COIN-OR?</a> <br> <blockquote> <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> is the Computational Infrastructure
for Operations Research project and is a consortium of researchers and
practitioners from both academia and industry who support the development og
open-source software tools for operations research. The project is run by the
non-profit <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/foundation.html">COIN-OR
Foundation</a>. The software available on this site is part of the <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a> software repository. All software
available at this site uses <a href="http://www.coin-or.org">COIN-OR</a>'s
open-source license, called the <a

Public License</a>. </blockquote>

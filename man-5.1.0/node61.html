An Object-oriented Approach</A>
</H2>

<P>
As we have already alluded to, applying BCP to large-scale problems
presents several difficult challenges. First and foremost is designing
methods and data structures capable of handling the potentially huge
numbers of cuts and variables that need to be accounted for during the
solution process. The dynamic nature of the algorithm requires that we
must also be able to efficiently move cuts and variables in and out of
the <EM>active set</EM> of each search node at any time. A second,
closely-related challenge is that of effectively dealing with the very
large search trees that can be generated for difficult problem
instances. This involves not only the important question of how to
store the data, but also how to move it between modules during
parallel execution. A final challenge in developing a generic
framework, such as SYMPHONY, is to deal with these issues using a
problem-independent approach.

<P>
Describing a node in the search tree consists of, among other things,
specifying which cuts and variables are initially <EM>active</EM> in the
subproblem. In fact, the vast majority of the methods in BCP that
depend on the model are related to generating, manipulating, and
storing the cuts and variables. Hence, SYMPHONY can be considered an
object-oriented framework with the central ``objects'' being the cuts
and variables. From the user's perspective, implementing a BCP
algorithm using SYMPHONY consists primarily of specifying various
properties of objects, such as how they are generated, how they are
represented, and how they should be realized within the context of a
particular subproblem.

<P>
With this approach, we achieved the ``black box'' structure by
separating these problem-specific functions from the rest of the
implementation. The internal library interfaces with the user's
subroutines through a well-defined Application Program Interface (API) (see
Section <A HREF="node206.html#API">6.3</A>)
and independently performs all the normal functions of BCP--tree
management, LP solution, and cut pool management, as well as inter-process
communication (when parallelism is employed). Although there are
default options for many of the operations, the user can also assert
control over the behavior of the algorithm by overriding the default
methods or by parameter setting.

<P>
Although we have described our approach as being ``object-oriented,''
we would like to point out that SYMPHONY is implemented in C, not C++.
To avoid inefficiencies and enhance the modularity of the code
(allowing for easy parallelization), we used a more
``function-oriented'' approach for the implementation of certain
aspects of the framework. For instance, methods used for communicating
data between modules are not naturally ``object-oriented'' because the
type of data being communicated is usually not known by the
message-passing interface. It is also common that efficiency
considerations require that a particular method be performed on a
whole set of objects at once rather than on just a single object.
Simply invoking the same method sequentially on each of the members of
the set can be extremely inefficient. In these cases, it is far better
to define a method which operates on the whole set at once. In order
to overcome these problems, we have also defined a set of <EM>interface functions</EM>, which are associated with the computational
modules. These function is described in detail in Section <A HREF="node206.html#API">6.3</A>.

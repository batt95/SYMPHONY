The Interactive Graph Drawing (IGD) software package is included with
SYMPHONY and SYMPHONY facilitates its use through interfaces with the
package. The package, which is a Tcl/Tk application, is extremely
useful for developing and debugging applications involving graph-based
problems. Given display coordinates for each node in the graph, IGD
can display support graphs corresponding to fractional solutions with or
without edge weights and node labels and weights, as well as other
information. Furthermore, the user can interactively modify the graph
by, for instance, moving the nodes apart to ``disentangle'' the
edges. The user can also interactively enter violated cuts through the
IGD interface.
<P>
To use IGD, you must have installed PVM since the drawing window runs
as a separate application and communicates with the user's routines
through message passing. To compile the graph drawing application,
type ``<TT>make dglib dg</TT>'' in the SYMPHONY root directory. The user
routines in the file <TT>dg_user.c</TT> can be filled in, but it is not
necessary to fill anything in for basic applications.
<P>
After compiling <TT>dg</TT>, the user must write some subroutines that
communicate with <TT>dg</TT> and cause the graph to be drawn.
Regrettably, this is currently a little more complicated than it needs
to be and is not well documented. However, by looking at the sample
application, it is relatively easy to see how it should be done. To
enable graph drawing, put the line <TT>do_draw_graph 1</TT> into the
parameter file or use the <TT>-d</TT> command line option.

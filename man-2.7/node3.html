<P>
Here is a sketch outline of how to get started with SYMPHONY. This is
basically the same information contained in the README file that comes
with the distribution.
<P>
<UL><LI> First unpack the distribution by typing ``<TT>tar -xzf
	SYMPHONY-2.7.tgz</TT>''.<LI> Edit the various path variables in the make file (<TT>
	SYPHONY-2.7/Makefile</TT>) to match where you installed the source
	code and where the LP libraries and header files reside for
	each architecture on your network. Other
	architecture-dependent variables should also be set as
	required. Be sure to read the comments in the make file to
	understand what variables have to be set.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Compiling the sequential version</B>
<P>
<UL><LI> Type ``<TT>make</TT>'' in the SYMPHONY root directory. This
	will first make the SYMPHONY library (sequential version).
	After this step is completed, you are free to type ``<TT>make
	clean</TT>'' and/or delete the <TT>$ROOT/obj.*</TT> and <TT>
	$ROOT/dep.*</TT> directories if you want to save disk space. You
	should only have to remake the library if you change something
	in SYMPHONY's internal files.<LI> After making the libraries, SYMPHONY will compile the
	user code and then make the executable for the sample
	application, a vehicle routing and traveling salesman problem
	solver. The name of the executable will be ``<TT>
	master_tm_lp_cg_cp</TT>'', indicating that all modules are
	contained in a single executable.<LI> To test the sample program, first get some
	problem files from http://branchandcut.org/VRP/. Make sure
	the executable directory is in your path and type
	&quot;master_tm_lp_cg_cp -F sample.vrp&quot;, where sample.vrp is the
	sample problem file.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Compiling for shared memory</B>
<P>
<UL><LI> To compile a shared memory version, obtain an OpenMP
	compliant compiler, such as <A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="http://pdplab.trc.rwcp.or.jp/Omni/">Omni</A>. Other options are listed
	at <A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="http://www.openmp.org">the OpenMP Web
	site</A>.<LI> Set the variable <TT>CC</TT> to the compiler name in the
	make file and compile as above.<LI> Voila, you have a shared memory parallel solver.<LI> Note that if you have previously compiled the sequential
	version, then you should first type ``<TT>make clean_all</TT>'',
	as this version uses the same compilation directories as the
	sequential version. With one active subproblem allowed, it
	should run exactly the same as the sequential version so there
	is no need to compile both.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Compiling for distributed networks</B>
<P>
<UL><LI> You must first obtain and install the <EM>
	<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/">Parallel Virtual
	Machine</A></EM> (PVM) software,
	available for free from Oak Ridge National
	Laboratories. See Section <A HREF="node10.html#PVM">1.6</A> for more
	notes on using PVM.<LI> In the Makefile, be sure to set the <TT>COMM_PROTOCOL</TT>
	to <TT>PVM</TT>. Also, change one or more of <TT>
	COMPILE_IN_TM</TT>, <TT>COMPILE_IN_LP</TT>, <TT>
	COMPILE_IN_CG</TT>, and <TT>COMPILE_IN_CP</TT>, to <TT>FALSE</TT>,
	or you will end up with the sequential version. Various
	combinations of these variables will give you different
	configurations and different executables. See Section
	<A HREF="node14.html#configuration">1.10</A> for more info on setting them. Also, be
	sure to set the path variables in the make file appropriately
	so that make can find the PVM library.<LI> Type ``<TT>make</TT>'' in the SYMPHONY root directory to
	make the distributed libraries. As in Step 1 of the sequential
	version, you may type ``<TT>make clean</TT>'' after making the
	library. It should not have to remade again unless you modify
	SYMPHONY's internal files.<LI> After the libraries, all executables requested will be made.<LI> Make sure there are links from your
	$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH/ directory to each of the
	executables in the Vrp/bin.$REV directory. This is required
	by PVM.<LI> Start the PVM daemon by typing ``<TT>pvm</TT>'' on the command line
	and then typing ``<TT>quit</TT>''.<LI> Run the sample application by typing ``<TT>master -F
	sample.vrp</TT>''. The actual executable name may not be ``<TT>
	master</TT>'' if <TT>COMPILE_IN_TM</TT> is set to <TT>TRUE</TT>. See
	Section <A HREF="node14.html#configuration">1.10</A> for more information on executable
	names.
</UL>
<P>
This should result in the successful compilation of the sample
application. Once you have accomplished this much, you are well on
your way to having an application of your own. Don't be daunted by the
seemingly endless list of user function that you are about to
encounter. Most of them are optional or have default options. If you
get lost, consult the source code for the sample application to see
how it's done.

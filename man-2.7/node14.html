In the <TT>make</TT> file, there are
four variables that control which modules run as separate executables
and which are called directly in serial fashion. The variables are as
follows:
<DL ><DT><STRONG>COMPILE_IN_CG:</STRONG>
<DD> If set to <TT>TRUE</TT>, then the cut generator
	function will be called directly from the LP in serial
	fashion, instead of running as a separate executable. This is
	desirable if cut generation is quick and running it in
	parallel is not worth the price of the communication overhead.
	<DT><STRONG>COMPILE_IN_CP:</STRONG>
<DD> If set to <TT>TRUE</TT>, then the cut
	pool(s) will be maintained as a data structure auxiliary to the
	tree manager. 
	<DT><STRONG>COMPILE_IN_LP:</STRONG>
<DD> If set to <TT>TRUE</TT>, then the LP
	functions will be called directly from the tree manager. When
	running the distributed version, this
	necessarily implies that there will only be one active
	subproblem at a time, and hence the code will essentially be
	running serially. IN the shared-memory version, however, the
	tree manager will be threaded in order to execute subproblems 
	in parallel.
	<DT><STRONG>COMPILE_IN_TM:</STRONG>
<DD> If set to <TT>TRUE</TT>, then the tree
	will be managed directly from the master process. This is only
	recommended if a single executable is desired (i.e.&nbsp;the three
	other variables are also set to true). A single executable is
	extremely useful for debugging purposes.
<P>
 </DL>
These variables can be set in virtually any combination, though some
don't really make much sense. Note that in a few user functions that
involve process communication, there will be different versions for
serial and parallel computation. This is accomplished through the use
of <TT>#ifdef</TT> statements in the source code. This is well documented
in the function descriptions and the in the source files containing
the function stubs. See also Section <A HREF="node11.html#shared">1.7</A>.

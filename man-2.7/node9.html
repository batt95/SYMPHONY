While the implementation of SYMPHONY strives to shield the user from
having to know anything about communications protocols or the
specifics of inter-process communication, it may be necessary for the
user to pass information from one module to another in some
cases--for instance, if the user must pass problem-specific data to
the LP process after reading them in from a data file. In cases where
this might be appropriate, user functions are supplied in pairs--a
<EM>send</EM> function and a <EM>receive</EM> function. All data are sent in
the form of arrays of either type <TT>char</TT>, <TT>int</TT>, or <TT>
double</TT>, or as strings. To send an array, the user has simply to
invoke the function <TT>send_?_array(? *array, int length)</TT> where ?
is one of the previously listed types. To receive that array, there is
a corresponding function called <TT>receive_?_array(? *array, int
length)</TT>. When receiving an array, the user must first
allocate the appropriate amount of memory. In cases where variable
length arrays need to be passed, the user must first pass the length
of the array (as a separate array of length one) and then the array
itself. In the receive function, this allows the length to be received
first so that the proper amount of space can be allocated before
receiving the array itself. Note that data must be received in exactly
the same order as it was passed, as data is read linearly into and out
of the message buffer. The easiest way to ensure this is done properly
is to simply copy the send statements into the receive function and
change the function names. It may then be necessary to add some
allocation statements in between the receive function calls.

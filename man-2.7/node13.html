Once the user functions are filled in, all that remains is to compile
the application. The distribution comes with two make files that
facilitate this process. The primary make file resides in the root
directory. The user make file resides in the user's subdirectory,
initally called <TT>User/</TT>. There are a number of variables that must
be set in the primary make file. Read the comments in the file <TT>
SYMPHONY-2.7/Makefile</TT> to ensure that everything is set properly. The
user make file shouldn't require much modification unless you add
source files other than the ones included in the distribution or
change their names.
<P>
When you are ready, type ``<TT>make</TT>'' to make the executables.
SYMPHONY will create three subdirectories--<TT>User/obj.*</TT>, <TT>
User/bin.*</TT>, and <TT>User/dep.*</TT> where * is a number corresponding
the current architecture (determined by the <TT>PVM_ARCH</TT>
environment variable). Note that if you don't have PVM installed, you
should either modify the make file appropriately (read the make file
to see how to do this) or set the <TT>PVM_ARCH</TT> environment variable
by hand. If your architecture is not be listed in the make file,
edit it by following the example set by the architectures already
included. Make sure to set the corresponding path variables properly.
Be sure to also set the proper links from the <TT>
$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH</TT> as explained in the previous section
if you are compiling a distributed version.

<DL ><DT><STRONG>Description:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
There are two user-written functions invoked from <TT>
select_candidates_u</TT>. The first one
(<TT><A HREF="node55.html#user_shall_we_branch">user_shall_we_branch()</A></TT>) decides
whether to branch at all, the second one (<TT>
<A HREF="node56.html#user_select_candidates">user_select_candidates()</A></TT>) chooses
the branching objects. The argument lists of the two functions are the
same, and if branching occurs (see discussion below) then the contents
of <TT>*cand_num</TT> and <TT>*candidates</TT> will not change between the
calls to the two functions.<BR> 
<BR> 
The first of these two functions is invoked in each iteration
after solving the LP relaxation and (possibly) generating cuts.
Therefore, by the time it is called, some violated cuts might be known.
Still, the user might decide to branch anyway. The second function is
invoked only when branching is decided on.<BR> 
<BR> 
Given (1) the number of known violated cuts that can be added to the
problem when this function is invoked, (2) the constraints that are
slack in the LP relaxation, (3) the slack cuts not in the matrix that
could be branched on (more on this later), and (4) the solution to the
current LP relaxation, the user must decide whether to branch or not.
Branching can be done either on variables or slack cuts. A pool of
slack cuts which has been removed from the problem and kept for
possible branching is passed to the user. If any of these happen to
actually be violated (it is up to the user to determine this), they
can be passed back as branching candidate type <TT>VIOLATED_SLACK</TT>
and will be added into the current relaxation. In this case, branching
does not have to occur (the structure of the <TT>*candidates</TT> array
is described below in <TT><A HREF="node56.html#user_select_candidates">user_select_candidates()</A></TT>). <BR> 
<BR> 
This function has two outputs. The first output is <TT>*action</TT> which
can take four values: <TT>USER__DO_BRANCH</TT> if the user wants to
branch, <TT>USER__DO_NOT_BRANCH</TT> if he doesn't want to branch,
<TT>USER__BRANCH_IF_MUST</TT> if he wants to branch only if there are
no known violated cuts, or finally <TT>USER__BRANCH_IF_TAILOFF</TT> if he
wants to branch in case tailing off is detected. The second output is the
number of candidates and their description. In this function the only
sensible ``candidates'' are <TT>VIOLATED_SLACK</TT>s. <BR> 
<BR> 
There is no post processing, but in case branching is
selected, the <TT>col_gen_before_branch()</TT> function is invoked
before the branching would take place. If that function finds dual
infeasible variables then (instead of branching) they are added to the
LP relaxation and the problem is resolved. (Note that the behavior of
the <TT>col_gen_before_branch()</TT> is governed by the <TT>
colgen_strat[]</TT> TM parameters.)

<DT><STRONG>Notes:</STRONG>
<DD> 
<UL><LI> The user has to allocate the pointer array for the
	candidates and place the pointer for the array into <TT>
	***candidates</TT> (if candidates are returned).<LI> Candidates of type <TT>VIOLATED_SLACK</TT> are always
	added to the LP relaxation regardless of what <TT>action</TT> is
	chosen and whether branching will be carried out or not.<LI> Also note that the user can change his mind in 
	<TT><A HREF="node56.html#user_select_candidates">user_select_candidates()</A></TT> and not branch after all, even if
	she chose to branch in this function. A possible scenario:
	<TT>cut_num</TT> is zero when this function is invoked and the
	user asks for <TT>USER__BRANCH_IF_MUST</TT> without checking
	the slack constraints and slack cuts. Afterwards no columns
	are generated (no dual infeasible variables found) and thus
	SYMPHONY decides branching is called for and invokes 
	<TT><A HREF="node56.html#user_select_candidates">user_select_candidates()</A></TT>. 
	However, in that function the
	user checks the slack cuts, finds that some are violated,
	cancels the branching request and adds the violated cuts to
	the relaxation instead.
</UL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG><B>Warning:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
The cuts the user unpacks and wants to be added to the
problem (either because they are of type <TT>VIOLATED_SLACK</TT> or type
<TT>CANDIDATE_CUT_NOT_IN_MATRIX</TT>) will be deleted from the list
of slack cuts after this routine returns. Therefore the same
warning applies here as in the function <TT>
<A HREF="node62.html#user_unpack_cuts">user_unpack_cuts()</A></TT>.

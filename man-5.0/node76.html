<P>
The easiest way to get oriented is to examine the organization of the source
files (note that file names will be given Unix-style). When you unpack the
SYMPHONY distribution, you will notice that the source files are organized along
the lines of the modules.  There is a separate directory for each
module--master (<TT>Master</TT>), tree manager (<TT>TreeManager</TT>), cut
generator (<TT>CutGen</TT>), cut pool (<TT>CutPool</TT>), and LP solver (<TT>LP</TT>). In addition, there is a directory called <TT>DrawGraph</TT> and a directory
called <TT>Common</TT> that also contain source files. The <TT>DrawGraph</TT>
directory provides an interface from SYMPHONY to the <EM>Interactive Graph
Drawing</EM> software package developed by Marta Es&#246;. This is an excellent
utility for graphical display and debugging. The <TT>Common</TT> directory
contains source code for functions used by multiple modules.

<P>
Within each module's directory, there is a primary source file
containing the function <TT>main()</TT> (named <TT>*.c</TT> where * is the
module name), a source file containing functions related to
inter-process communication (named <TT>*_proccomm.c</TT>) and a file
containing general subroutines used by the module (named <TT>*_func.c</TT>). The master is the exception and is organized slightly
differently. The LP process source code is further subdivided due to
the sheer number of functions.

<P>
The <TT>include</TT> directory contains the header files. Corresponding
to each module, there are three header files, one containing internal
data structures and function prototypes associated with the module
(named <TT>*.h</TT> where * is the module name), one containing the data
structures for storing the parameters (these are also used by the
master process), and the third containing the function prototypes for
the user callbacks (name <TT>*_u.h</TT>). By looking at the header files, you
should get a general idea of how things are laid out.

<P>
In addition to the subdirectories corresponding to each module, there is a
subdirectory called <TT>SYMPHONY-5.0/USER</TT>, which contains the files
needed for implementing the callbacks. Before beginning
customization, it is recommended to make a copy of the directory
<TT>SYMPHONY-5.0/USER</TT> that will be used as a template for creating your
customized solver. In this directory and its subdirectories, which mirror the
subdirectories of SYMPHONY itself, each file contains function stubs that can
be filled in to create a new custom application. There is one file for each
module, initially called <TT>SYMPHONY-5.0/USER/*/user_*.c</TT>, where
<TT>*</TT> is the name of the module. The primary thing that you, as the user,
need to understand to build a custom application is how to fill in these
stubs. That is what the second section of this manual is about.

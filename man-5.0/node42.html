Modifying Problem Data.</A>
</H4>

<P>
If the user modifies problem data in between calls to the solver, SYMPHONY
must make corresponding modifications to the leaf nodes of the current search
tree to allow execution of the algorithm to continue. In principle, any change
to the original data that does not invalidate the subproblem warm start data,
i.e., the basis information for the LP relaxation, can be
accommodated. Currently, SYMPHONY can only handle modifications to the rim
vectors of the original MILP. Methods for handling other modifications, such as
the addition of columns or the modification of the constraint matrix itself,
will be added in the future. To initialize the algorithm, each leaf node,
regardless of its status after termination of the previous solve call, must be
inserted into the queue of candidate nodes and reprocessed with the changed
rim vectors. After this reprocessing, the computation can continue as usual.
Optionally, the user can ``trim the tree'' before resolving. This consists of
locating nodes whose descendants are all likely to be pruned in the resolve
and eliminating those descendants in favor of processing the parent node
itself. This ability could be extended to allow changes that invalidate the
warm start data of some leaf nodes.

<P>
The ability to resolve after modifying problem data has a wide range of
applications in practice. One obvious use is to allow dynamic modification of
problem data during the solve procedure, or even after the procedure has been
completed. Implementing such a solver is simply a matter of periodically
stopping to check for user input describing a change to the problem. Another
obvious application is in situations where it is known a priori that the user
will be solving a sequence of very similar MILPs. This occurs, for instance,
when implementing algorithms for multicriteria optimization, as we describe in
Section <A HREF="node43.html#mc_solve">4.2.1</A>. One approach to this is to solve a given ``base
problem'' (possibly limiting the size of the warm start tree), save the warm
start information from the base problem and then start each subsequent call
from this same checkpoint. Code for implementing this was shown in Figure
<A HREF="node20.html#warm_start">3.3</A>.

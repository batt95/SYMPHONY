<P>
Although SYMPHONY was originally designed as a parallel code, it
can be built in a variety of configurations ranging from completely
parallel to fully sequential using the same source code. As described
in the previous section, there are five modules in the standard
fully-parallel configuration. However, various combinations of these
modules can be linked together into ``combined'' modules depending on
the user's needs. For instance, if cut generation is fast and not
memory-intensive, it may not be worthwhile to have the LP solver and its
associated cut generator working independently since this increases
communication overhead. In this case, the separation function can be
called directly from the LP solver, creating a single, more efficient
executable. For debugging purposes, it is often convenient to have the
entire framework run as a single executable. This may also be more
efficient if only one LP process is to be used. These and other
configurations can be specified at compile time.

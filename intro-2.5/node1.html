SYMPHONY (Single- or Multi-Process Optimization over Networks) is a
state-of-the-art, parallel implementation of the <EM>branch, cut, and
price algorithm</EM>, referred to henceforth as simply <EM>branch and
cut</EM>. This general class of algorithm has long been the method of
choice for solving hard combinatorial and general mixed-integer
optimization problems. However, because of the inherent need for
problem-dependent techniques (most notably separation), implementation
has often been time-consuming and difficult. SYMPHONY seeks to
minimize these difficulties by providing a generic library that
implements the framework of the algorithm, while requiring the user to
supply only those subroutines that depend on the problem setting.
<P>
To develop a full-scale, parallel branch, cut, and price algorithm,
the user has only to supply a few problem-specific functions that
depend on the problem setting, such as preprocessing and separation.
The vast majority of the computation takes place within a ``black
box,'' of which the user need have no knowledge. The internal library
communicates with the user's routines through well-defined interfaces
and performs all the normal functions of branch and cut--tree
management, LP solution, and cut pool management, as well as
inter-process communication. Although there are default options, the
user can also assert control over the behavior of the algorithm
through a myriad of parameters and optional subroutines. The
executables can be built in a variety of configurations, ranging from
fully parallel to completely sequential, depending on the user's
needs. The software runs serially on almost any platform, and can run
in parallel in any environment supported by the PVM message-passing
protocol. SYMPHONY can be used in a variety of problem-settings and
has already been ported to solve the <EM>Traveling Salesman Problem</EM>
(TSP) ([<A HREF="node34.html#Lthesis">15</A>]), <EM>Vehicle Routing Problem</EM> (VRP)
([<A HREF="node34.html#thesis">20</A>, <A HREF="node34.html#Leo">14</A>]), and the <EM>Set Partitioning Problem</EM>
([<A HREF="node34.html#Marta">6</A>]).

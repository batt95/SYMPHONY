<P>
Although SYMPHONY is a mature software library and already contains
the advanced features required for most uses, some future
enhancements are planned. Currently, there are two new versions under
development. One of these versions will use shared memory and will be
developed using the OpenMP protocol. Another version, currently
code-named BCP and under development at IBM, implements SYMPHONY in C++
with several enhancements, such as the ability to generate arbitrary
variables (making the handling of cuts and variables completely
symmetrical), better fault tolerance and virtual machine handling,
better cut pool scanning, and a more generalized branching
scheme.
<P>
The current version of SYMPHONY will continue to be enhanced as well.
One of the biggest changes planned is to better implement
load-balancing. One way of achieving this will be through dynamic
allocation of cut generators. Rather than requiring each LP to have
its own dedicated cut generator, cut generators will be allocated as
needed to LP processes so that more cut generation can be devoted to
areas of the tree that are ``difficult'' and less to areas that are
``easy.'' This idea was investigated for Set Partitioning in
[<A HREF="node34.html#Marta">6</A>] and found to be effective. Other planned enhancements
include eliminating the requirement for the user to index problem
variables, allowing solution of a wider variety of models, and the
addition of generic cutting plane routines, allowing ``out of the
box'' problem solution.

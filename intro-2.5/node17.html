Just as with variables, the constraints are divided into <EM>base
constraints</EM> and <EM>extra constraints</EM>. The base constraints are
those that are included in every LP relaxation, whereas the extra
constraints are generated dynamically and are free to enter and leave
the relaxation. Typically, the base constraints are some subset of the
constraints in the integer programming formulation of the problem.
For example, in the Traveling Salesman Problem, the set of base
constraints could simply consist of the degree constraints. Obviously,
the set of base constraints must be known explicitly. Extra
constraints, on the other hand, are generated dynamically by the cut
generator as they are violated. As with variables, the constraints in
the current relaxation are called the <EM>active constraints</EM>.
<P>
Since SYMPHONY has no knowledge of the structure of the cuts being
generated, it is up to the user, if desired, to designate a packed
form for each class of cut and to implement cut packing and unpacking
subroutines. For instance, suppose that the set of nonzero variables
in a particular class of cuts corresponds to the set of edges across a
cut in a graph. Instead of storing the indices of each variable
explicitly, it is more efficient to simply store the set of nodes on
one side of the cut as a bit array. The cut can then be constructed
easily for the particular set of active variables (edges) in the
problem at the time.

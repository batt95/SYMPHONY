<P>
The algorithm described here is what is known as asynchronous,
single-pool branch and cut. The term <EM>asynchronous</EM> was discussed
in Section <A HREF="node5.html#parallelizing">3</A>. The term <EM>single-pool</EM> refers to
the fact that there is a single central list of candidate subproblems
to be processed, which is maintained by the tree manager. For a
description of other types of parallel branch and bound, see
[<A HREF="node34.html#GSPMampC">10</A>].
<P>
The master process begins by reading in the parameters and problem
data. After initial I/O is completed, user-written routines for
finding an initial upper bound and constructing the root node are
executed (see Section <A HREF="node20.html#master">5.1</A> for details), the tree manager
process is spawned, and the data for the root node are sent to it. The
tree manager in turn spawns the cut pool processes, the linear
program processes, and the cut generator processes. Each LP process has
a single cut generator associated with it which serves requests from
that LP process alone. The root node is placed on the candidate node
list and the initial upper bound is set equal to the best heuristic
upper bound found. All LPs are marked as idle. The algorithm is ready
for execution.

<P>
In the steady state, the tree manager controls the execution by
maintaining the list of candidate subproblems and sending them to the
LP processes as they become idle. The LP processes receive nodes from
the tree manager, process them, branch (if required), and send back
the identity of the chosen branching object to the tree manager, which
in turn generates the children and places them on the list of
candidates to be processed. A
schematic summary of the algorithm is shown in Figure <A HREF="node11.html#overview">4</A>,
although some of the ideas in this summary have not yet been
presented.
The preference ordering for processing nodes is a parameter that can
be set by the user. The default is to choose the node with the lowest
lower bound to be processed next, because this is in some sense the
node that is most likely to be on a path to an optimal solution. The
concepts of <EM>diving</EM> and <EM>search chains</EM>, introduced in
Section <A HREF="node26.html#treemanagement">5.3.1</A>, extend this basic approach.

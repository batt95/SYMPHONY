Algorithm Summary
</H2><FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><FONT COLOR="#a52a2a">Currently, SYMPHONY is what is known as a single-pool BCP algorithm.
The term <EM>single-pool</EM> refers to the fact that there is a single
central list of candidate subproblems to be processed, which is
maintained by the tree manager. Most sequential implementations use
such a single-pool scheme. However, other schemes may be used in
parallel implementations. For a description of various types of
parallel branch and bound, see [<A
 HREF="node282.html#gend:paral">16</A>].
</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><FONT COLOR="#a52a2a">The user begins by initializing the SYMPHONY environment and can then invoke
subroutines for reading in parameters and problem data, finding an initial
upper bound, and designating the initial set of active cuts and variables in
the root node. Once the user invokes a solve routine, a tree manager is
created to manage the solution process. The tree manager module in turn sets
up the cut pool module(s), the linear programming module(s), and the cut
generator module(s). Currently, there are three solve calls supported by the
API. The first call is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">initial solve</SPAN> (see Section
<A HREF="node76.html#initial_solve">4.4.1.1</A>), which solves the problem from scratch without using warm
start information. The second type of solve call is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">warm solve</SPAN>, which
solves the problem using previously computed warm start information (see
Section <A HREF="node77.html#warm_solve">4.4.1.2</A>). Finally, there is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">multicriteria solve</SPAN> call
which is used to enumerate efficient solutions to a given multicriteria MILP
(see Section <A HREF="node80.html#mc_solve">4.4.1.3</A>).
</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><FONT COLOR="#a52a2a">During the solution process, the tree manager functions control the execution
by maintaining the list of candidate subproblems and sending them to the NP
modules as they become idle. The NP modules receive nodes from the tree
manager, process them, branch (if required), and send back the identity of the
chosen branching object to the tree manager, which in turn generates the
children and places them on the list of candidates to be processed (see
Section <A HREF="node84.html#branching">4.4.2.3</A> for a description of the branching operation). A
schematic summary of the algorithm is shown in Figure <A HREF="node67.html#overview">4.4</A>. The
preference ordering for processing nodes is a run-time parameter. Typically,
the node with the smallest lower bound is chosen to be processed next since
this strategy minimizes the overall size of the search tree. However, at
times, it is advantageous to <EM>dive</EM> down in the tree. The concepts of <EM>diving</EM> and <EM>search chains</EM>, introduced in Section <A HREF="node85.html#tree-management">4.4.3</A>,
extend the basic ``best-first'' approach.
</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><FONT COLOR="#a52a2a">We mentioned earlier that cuts and variables can be treated in a
somewhat symmetric fashion. However, it should be clear by now
that our current implementation favors the implementation of
branch and cut algorithms, where the computational effort spent
generating cuts dominates that of generating variables. Our methods of
representation also clearly favor such problems. In a future version
of the software, we plan to erase this bias by adding additional
functionality for handling variable generation and storage. This is
the approach already taken by of COIN/BCP [<A
 HREF="node282.html#coin-or">24</A>]. For more
discussion of the reasons for this bias and the differences between
the treatment of cuts and variables, see Section <A HREF="node83.html#lp-relaxation">4.4.2.2</A>.
